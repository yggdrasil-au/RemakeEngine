# EngineApps Readme
Main Files for EngineNet (Remake Engine .Net)

## Games/
container for game modules executed by the engine


## Registries/
container for internal components used by the engine


### Registries/Modules/
contains Main.json wich lists all verified Game Modules, download links, and metadata for each module.


### Registries/ops/
container for internal modules operations.toml files used by the engine


### Registries/Tools/
container for main.json which lists all verified tools, download links, and metadata for each tool.


## Tools/
blender:
the exe path set to blender.exe however it can be set to blender-launcher.exe but blender.exe will produce cli ouput and error ouput unlike blender-launcher.exe,
so blender.exe best for verbose logging and blender-launcher.exe best for silent running.

#### todo: seperate main.json into individual json files for each tool, possibly even major versions of each tool, the main json will get too large otherwise.
