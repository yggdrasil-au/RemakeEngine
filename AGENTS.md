## Setup
- Build: `dotnet build RemakeEngine.sln -c Debug`
- Run tests: `dotnet test EngineNet.Tests\EngineNet.Tests.csproj -c Debug --no-build --logger "trx;LogFileName=test_results.trx"`

## Use Exact Code style
read [Style.md](Style.md)

## CONTRIBUTING
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and workflows.

## main Readme
See [README.md](README.md) for an overview of the Remake Engine project.

## submodules
sub modules are created manually, as the modules should usually be downloaded by the engine itself, but for development purposes, you can write this file.
.gitmodules

This is the main game module used to develop the engine, it is also a real project for creating a remake of The Simpsons Game 2007 from PS3.
```
[submodule "EngineApps/Games/TheSimpsonsGame-PS3"]
    path = EngineApps/Games/TheSimpsonsGame-PS3
    url = https://github.com/Superposition28/TheSimpsonsGame-PS3.git
```
This is the documentation repository for the Remake Engine.
```
[submodule "RemakeEngineDocs"]
    path = RemakeEngineDocs
    url = https://github.com/yggdrasil-au/RemakeEngineDocs.git
```

Always test Engine functionality with the demo game module "demo" when making changes to the engine, using the cli direct operation execution commands
```pwsh
dotnet run -c Release
 --project EngineNet
 --framework net9.0
 --
 --game_module ".\EngineApps\Games\demo\"
 --script_type lua
 --script "{{Game_Root}}/scripts/lua_feature_demo.lua"
 --args ["--module", "RemakeRegistry/Games/demo", "--scratch", "RemakeRegistry/Games/demo/TMP/lua-demo", "--note", "Hello from the Lua demo"]
```
when adding new new features, or changing existing features update the lua script to demonstrate the feature in the demo game module located at `EngineApps/Games/demo/scripts/lua_feature_demo.lua`
